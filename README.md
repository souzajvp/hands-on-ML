# hands-on-ML
Repository to work through the book "Hands–On Machine Learning with Scikit–Learn and TensorFlow 2e: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems".

## Plan of work
Considering that the book has extensive theoretical and practical content, I plan to work like so:
1. Prepare small summaries of each subject;
2. Execute the code examples.

Depending on the subject depth, I plan to post the summaries and code bits in my LinkedIn and Medium accounts.

I hope to conclude this book, tryng all the code examples and answering the exercises in a period of 6 monhts.
Date I started the project: 03/22/2021
Maximum date to finish it : 09/22/2021
