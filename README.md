Repository to work through the book "Hands–On Machine Learning with Scikit–Learn and TensorFlow 2e: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems".

## Plan of work
Considering that the book has extensive theoretical and practical content, I plan to work like so:
1. Prepare small summaries of each subject;
2. Execute the code examples.

Depending on the subject depth, I plan to post the summaries and code bits in my LinkedIn and Medium accounts.

## Deadlines

I hope to conclude this book, trying all the code examples and answering the exercises in a period of 6 months.
* Date I started the project: 03/22/2021
* Maximum date to finish it : 09/22/2021

**First chapter conclusion**: 23/03/2021 <br>

**Second chapter conclusion**:30/03/2021 <br>

**Third chapter conclusion**: This chapter is essential for my near future. In this sense I am dedicating myself to work through it! The exercises are challenging, but I will finish them before going forward. <br>
