    "***\n",
    "   Among many possible advantadges, ML is extremely useful at solving complex problems that would take much longer using standard approaches. Let's say you are interested in building a program that is able to filter spam e-mails. How would you do it? Maybe you could start at going through some e-mails at focusing at the common terms used in spam x not-spam e-mails. Misspelled words, suspicious adresses or eyebombing terms could catch your atention and you would write a program that classifies e-mails with such terms as spam. <br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "These approaches were feasible before, but as we get more and more uses of internet and *data* shifts to *big data*, it would be impossible for a programmer to read thousands and thousands of e-mails and understand what words are related to spam messages.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "ML comes as a great set of tools because you could:\n",
    "1. Automatically detect words that are related to spam;\n",
    "2. The models can be trained with large ammounts of data;\n",
    "3. The same process of training and getting results can be repeated many times, regardless of the dataset. - whichs is really useful considering the evolution of the spam e-mails;\n",
